                        Instead of having daily stand-up meetings, use this bot
                        to get a more efficient take on what each member of
                        your team is working on and has accomplished each day.
                        Itâ€™s a fun way to keep track of the progress your team
                        is making over the long run, too.

                        Here's another great Slack integration for those 
                        times when you want to take a conversation 
                        face-to-face on a video conference call with a team 
                        member who isn't in your office. To do so, simply 
                        type /hangout to launch a Google+ Hangout in a new 
                        window:
                        <img src="multimedia/Hangout.png"><br>
                        That command will provide you with a link that you can use to 
                        quickly hop on a video call. <br>

                        After opening the video call window, you may have to login 
                        to your google account and also have the option of adding 
                        more participants to the call beyond which you are added to 
                        the meeting room.

                      <p>
                        A lot of people use Google Drive to store files 
                        securely online, access them from anywhere, and 
                        collaborate with others. If you're one of these 
                        people, the Google Drive app is a great way to 
                        make sharing files among teammates a lot easier. <br>
                        
                        First and foremost, the app lets you share Drive files 
                        right in Slack. All you have to do is paste the 
                        shareable link in a Slack conversation, and it'll 
                        import the files in Slack. <br> 

                        If you haven't already connected your Google Drive 
                        to Slack, then Slack will guide you through the 
                        quick process of letting it "read" the file. 
                        (It'll only read and index files you decide to import.)<br>

                        Once you have everything set up, you'll be able to 
                        share the document right in Slack. <br>

                        You can also use another plugin to maintain one 
                        directory for the entire workspace to share. <br>

                        The best part about this app is that the files you 
                        import are easily searchable. Note, though, that they 
                        won't be actually stored in Slack -- they'll continue 
                        to be stored in Google Drive.
