                        Google Hangout's slack integration lets you 
                        make video calls with your workspace easy 
                        without having the need to continously set-up. <br>

                        Simply type /hangout to launch a Google+ Hangout in 
                        a new window:
                        <img src="multimedia/Hangout.png"><br>
                        That command will provide you with a link that you 
                        can use to quickly hop on a video call. <br>

                        After opening the video call window, you may have 
                        to login to your google account and also have 
                        the option of adding more participants to the 
                        call beyond which you are added to the meeting room.

                      </p>

                      <p>
                        Google Drive is used to store files online by 
                        almost everyone. This plugin links it with slack.
                        <br>
                        The plugin guides you through the initial set up
                        and you will be able to share files directly from
                        slack.<br>

                        You can also use another plugin to maintain one 
                        directory for the entire workspace to share. <br>

                        The best part about this app is that the files you 
                        import are easily searchable. Note, though, that they 
                        won't be actually stored in Slack -- they'll continue 
                        to be stored in Google Drive.
