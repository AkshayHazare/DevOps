            Build Tools Comparison
        </h1>

        <p>
            A "Build tool" is a single term that refers to anything that is 
            needed to get a piece of software set up, but isn't needed after 
            that. There are numerous number of build tools each having a 
            different set of tradeoffs associated with them. Here are some of
            the major build tools and their features:
        </p>
        <details>
                <summary class="sum2">
                    Make
                </summary>
                <ul class="nested">
                    <p>
                        Make was first created in 1976, but the variants of 
                        this build tool are still going strong in today’s world
                        of system development. In make we have to specify 
                        dependency followed by a rule to resolve those 
                        dependencies. It is a powerful product oriented tool 
                        which is highly capable of tracking dependencies within
                        a build and building only those parts/components
                        that have been updated/changed. Thus helping in 
                        optimizing performance whereby compilation time is 
                        crucial in development cycles. The drawback of this
                        tool is that with increase in the rise of complexity,
                        the number of dependency between their component also 
                        increases causing the rules even more complex
                        making it really hard to debug. To make things better 
                        for this drawback we regularly see teams making a 
                        MakeFile in each sub-directory and a top level
                        MakeFile. The top level MakeFile recursively runs the
                        subdirectories resulting in the build information and
                        processes to spread over many files. The other 
                        drawbacks of this tool is that due to significant 
                        amount of whitespaces it makes it susceptible to 
                        hard-to-find class of bugs. Make is also OS specific 
                        since it relies on shell scripting. Many developers
                        have started using SCons instead of Make.

                        Ant is a task oriented build tool which was first 
                        released in 2000. The limitations found in Make tool 
                        led to the Java Community to experiment different 
                        solutions such as porting Make to Java. At this same 
                        time XML was coming up into prominence as a build tool.
                        Combining the power of both these approaches led to the
                        Apache Ant build tool. Being fully cross platform , a 
                        set of instructions are writted in Java to basic 
                        operations like compilation and file manipulation.
                        Besides being cross-platform it is also an extremely 
                        flexible and powerful system, with Ant Tasks for most 
                        things we want to do. Despite of being powerful,
                        it comes with certain drawbacks namely the build 
                        scripts have to be written in XML (not quite pleasant 
                        for human readability), a lot of time has to be spent
                        in performing tasks (writing boiler plate to compile, 
                        create jars, run tests etc) due to lack of a real 
                        domain concept. Ant files are poorly factored and tend
                        to get really long, it wont be surprising if we see
                        thousands of lines long.

                        Maven is another build tool that was released in 2004. 
                        Maven was built with the goal to improve on the 
                        problems that were faced while using the Ant tool.
                        Maven still has use of XML but relatively less when 
                        compared to the Ant tool. Maven guaranties that it will
                        perform any kind of build, deploy, test and release 
                        task with a single command as long as we conform to the
                        structure dictated by Maven. The disadavntage lies in 
                        the fact that we have to conform to the Maven 
                        structure, if we dont follow the Maven structure then 
                        it is almost impossible to make Maven do what we want.
                        Another disadvantage lies in the fact that it uses an 
                        external DSL (Domain Specific Language) written in XML,
                        which means that if we want to extend it then we have 
                        to spend a lot of time learning something extra and 
                        making it work. Maven might also end up creating 
                        issues since it continuously tries to automatically 
                        upgrade itself every time it runs, this means some
                        plugins might end up failing and we wont be able to 
                        reproduce our builds.

                    Build tools are usually used to perform pre-checks in
                    the code before they are sent out for testing and
                    deployments.
                    Consider a scenario where there are hundreds of
                    developers working on the single project.
                    Each developers have certain unique coding style.
                    If each developer commits their changes according to
                    their style or ideology, there would be hundreds of
                    different styles leading to inconsistencies all
                    over code base. This is where build tools come into
                    picture. As seen in our class the use of html checker
                    allowed developers to deploy only after the
                    checks were successful. There are other aspects and
                    uses of build tools too. The build tools performs
                    dependencies check,
                    improve compile and link time and
                    reduces the bad builds.

                    PyBuild is one of the build tools which is largely
                    based for Python Projects.
                    PyBuild supports all the standard features of a
                    typical build tools.

                    There are tons of plugins created by Python
                    developers to
                    support easy building of Python Projects.
                    The plugins are present for the following
                    areas in Build:

                    <ul class="contents">
                      <li>Unit Testing</li>
                      <li>Measuring Unit Test Coverage</li>
                      <li>Linting Python Source</li>
                      <li>Python Checker</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>

                What is SonarQube?
                <br>
                <br>
                SonarQube is open source tool written in Java that helps 
                to analyze the quality of the source code.
                It has the ability to analyze the source code
                in 20+ language.

                Code analysis step can be used manually by executing 
                sonar runner but however the best use of SonarQube
                is during the build process.

                If SonarQube integrated with Jenkins server it 
                can provide continuous Integration and 
                reports based on the analyzis of the code.

                SonarQube is known for the integration of the various 
                technologies to analyze the code in a single version.
