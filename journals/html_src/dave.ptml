                  In this course , I expect of gaining knowledge on how the
                  whole software development process works. Getting more
                  understanding on all the aspects of software development
                  such as integration, testing, releasing to deployment , 
                  infrastructure management, workflow etc.

                          There were different teams such as coding,
                          development, cloud, monitoring and many more.
                          We were supposed to choose one of them and assigned
                          tasks accordingly. I selected monitoring team.
                          We will be using trello board to keep the track
                          of our work.

                          I learned about docker container and got to
                          implement it myself. Also, I chose “The art of
                          Monitoring” by James Turnbull for book review.
