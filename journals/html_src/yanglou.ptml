              Hello, this is Yang. I am a CS master student 
              at NYU Tandon. As a member in the coding team, 
              I am going to participate in the development 
              of Django quizzes app.

        <h2>Expected Outcomes</h2>
        <p>
            By taking the DevOps course, I am hoping to
            gain a solid understanding of what DevOps is
            all about, and get real experience with DevOps
            tools and practices. In addition, I plan to
            create a functional website with other coding
            team members using Django as the backend. I
            will also learn techniques and processes
            utilized by build, cloud, deployment, monitoring,
            security and testing teams.

                    I learned DevOps is a software development
                    methodology which uses Agile and lean principles
                    to improve collaboration between development
                    and operations engineers. The traditional waterfall
                    model comprises five phases including requirements,
                    design, implementation, verification and maintenance.
                    DevOps enables faster feedback loops that result
                    from delivering smaller batches of code more often,
                    compared with the waterfall model.

                    During the class, we cloned the professor's DevOps
                    repository, and were taught to use git submodule
                    commands. Our personal journal webpages for the
                    DevOps course were created locally and then pushed
                    to the DevOps repository.

                    The TA instructed us to download and install the

                    hub, and create a docker container to run the
                    DevOps website inside. The professor elaborated
                    some advantages to use docker when developing software.
                    I and another coding team member were assigned to
                    the task "Build quiz mechanism for Django".

                    DevOpsCourse. I taught myself how to use Django as a
                    beginner. The professor explained the reasons to
                    edit ptml files first. We used build automation tool
                    Make to generate html files and rebuilt the DevOps
                    website.
