        <h4>May 08, 2018 : Week 12</h4>
            We've been working on the jenkins script to test 
            all files.
            I have also finished the book assigned to me and 
            recommend 
            it to anyone entering the world of DevOps.
            This being the last few days of this course
            I am grateful for taking this fun and interesting course.
            I'm glad to have had lectures from Prof. Callahan as well 
            as the various industry professionals. I have learnt 
            a few technical and many interpersonal skills through 
            this course. Cheers to the first batch of NYU DevOps 2018!

        <h4>April 25, 2018 : Week 11</h4>
            In the past week I have written commands in Jenkins
            for build and testing each time git repo is updated. 
            I performed testing by intentionally changing a file 
            to have the wrong html tags. On pushing such a file, 
            an error was raised by Jenkins and notified on slack. 
            I am now working on the script to do so for all the files. 
            I also spent time reading Prof. Callahan’s paper 
            “The agile enterprise and division of labour” 
            found it to be very interesting with all real industry 
            examples. 
            </p>
        <p>
        <h4>April 19, 2018 : Week 10</h4>
            I have spent most of the week learning how to 
            write Ansible playbooks to work with AWS EC2 and 
            docker containers. We learnt that the AWS EC2 using 
            a linux machine does not support python2.7 and above. 
            As we require python3.6 to run all tests, we had to 
            create a new EC2 instance, this time we are using 
            an Ubuntu machine(it comes with pre-installed python3.6)
            <br>
            I also integrated Slack with Jenkins for notifications. 
            Our next step is to write a script, preferably a shell 
            script, to run test_html.sh on all html files.
            </p>
        
        <p>
        <h4>April 10, 2018 : Week 9</h4>
            The testing team has made progress with pipelining. 
            We installed jenkins on our EC2 server and tested 
            connection to a Github Repo. After getting credentials 
            from prof. we shall integrate with the DevOps repo instead.  
            </p>

        <h4>March 29, 2018 : Week 8</h4>
            Last week we had Joe West, CTO of BounceX meet us in class. 
            He spoke of 4 important things to know about DevOps and the t
            ools associated with it.</p> 
            <ul class="nested">
                <li>
                    Business is the thing: DevOps services are expensive 
                    and don't always save money. We must give thought to 
                    cost, business and purpose before resorting to the t
                    ools instead of using them just because they are cool.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Rightsize toolchain: many a times, our business 
                    may not need all of the tools. simple combination 
                    of EC2, CI/CD and a Db may suffice. hence, it is 
                    importnat to understand where the optimization is worth. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Productivity is the best practice: We must try to 
                    automate things that are done repeatedly and take 
                    much of our time.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Document and rehearse: Documentation is essential to 
                    keep a record for purposes of handover or backtracking 
                    or rollbacks. Rehearsing critical events makes us better 
                    equiped at handling the real scenarios.
                </li>
            </ul>

        <h4>March 21, 2018 : Week 7</h4>
            SPRING BREAK<BR>
            Over the spring break I practiced Oauth using Github so that 
            only a verified github user can access a server. I also tried
             creating a docker image for the Ruby app and experimented with
              different ways to do it. Docker image needs a DockerFile and 
              a docker-compose.yml file. I faced some difficulties in the 
              process because Docker makes use of VirtualBox, port assignment 
              and networking is not my strongest point! Lots more to learn 
              about containerization.
            </p>
        <p>
        <h4>March 13, 2018 : Week 6</h4>
            We had Tom from Google give us a lecture on the 
            Web Search and 
            Scheduling. He works in the team that handles 'Join' 
            on the database, 
            which sounds easy but is pretty complicated when 
            scaled to millions 
            of nodes that are accounted during a particular 
            google search or 
            inside gmail. He also explained the differences 
            between SRE and Engg.
            </p>
        <p>
        <h4>March 7, 2018 : Week 5</h4>
            I'd like to summarize the amazing session by 
            StackOverflow's Tom Limoncelli.
            Tom started off by telling us about what 
            misconceptions everyone has 
            about DevOps, how the term is often bound to 
            a few tools like Jenkins, 
            Ansible, etc. but in reality its much more 
            than that.<br>
            So here it is: DevOps is applying DevOps 
            priciples to simple software 
            engineering processes.<br>
            The DevOps principles are :<br>
            </p>
            <ul class="nested">
                <li>
                    3 ways: Process, Communication/Feedback, 
                    Innovation
                </li>
                <li>
                    small batches: Force Fail Frequently, 
                    frequency reduces risk.
                </li>
                <li>
                    MVP-Minimum Valuable Product: Deliver 
                    some value, small features 
                    sooner than delivering entire product in the end.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
            The latter part of the session included learning 
            about StackOverflow's 
            operations and technologies. I personally feel the 
            presentation and Tom's 
            funny relatable pictures and examples made an hour 
            seem less. Looking 
            forward to the next talk in coming week.
        </p>

        <h4>Feb 26, 2018 : Week 3, 4</h4>
            Here's a documentation of what we have done so 
            far in terms of codes and commands:

            1: Install Docker : <a href="https://www.docker.com/get-docker"> Get Docker</a> <br>
            2: Download docker image for Nginx: docker pull nginx <br>
            3: Create a Docker container using command as follow:<br>

                <div style="text-align: center;">
                    docker run --name DevopsNginx -p 8080:80 -v /Users/garima/Documents/Devops/DevOps:/usr/share/nginx/html nginx
                </div>
                <br>
                where --name is to specify the name of 
                container being created. 
                In above example, container name is 'DevopsNginx'<br>
                -p is used for 'port mapping'. 
                Here, 8080:80 specifies that port 8080 
                will now listen to port 80<br>
                -v is used for 'volume mapping'. 
                In above example, /usr/share/nginx/html 
                is mounted to /Users/garima/Documents/Devops/DevOps 
                (this is the same f
                older you have cloned the Devops repository to)<br>
            4: Use Kitematic to view all container and their status.

        </p>
        <p>
        <h4>Feb 14, 2018 : Week 2</h4>
            I have been assigned to the Testing team in this 
            Devops process. 
            Our goal is to create a pipeline with automated 
            testing on the code 
            push before deployment. Our first task was to compare 
            Jenkins, travis 
            CI and GoCD to make a choice for the pipeline. 
            So far I have researched 
            online with reference to GoCD in comparison to 
            Jenkins. Since we are a 
            team of 3 we have equally distributed work amongst us. <br>
            Coming to the book review, I am reviewing '
            The Phoenix project' and have 
            completed 3 chapters so far. A detailed review 
            shall be posted on books.html soon.
        </p>
        <p>
        <h4>Feb 7, 2018 : Week 1</h4>
            Intro: In Fall'16, I took the Distributed Systems class 
            under Prof. Rosenfeld
             and was introduced to concepts of Site Reliability, Server 
             Handling, CAP theorem
              and so on. A class that I took just to learn something 
              new, paved my way 
              into the world of Devops. <br>
            With the little that I could absorb in a span of those 4 
            months, I stepped 
            into the NYU IT office as a student worker. Under guidance of 
            my mentor and 
            tech lead, I refined my scripting skills, got hands-on 
            GitHub experience 
            and worked in an Agile-SCRUM environment. I was introduced t
            o automated 
            testing, pipelining, deployment for keeping NYU Web 
            Publishing service up and running.<br>
            In Devops Spring 2018 I look forward to team building and 
            collaborative work.
