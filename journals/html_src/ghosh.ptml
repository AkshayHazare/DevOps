        <p>
        After completing my undergraduate studies, I worked at
        Sapient where I was exposed to Agile development technique.
        As a fresh undergrad, I had never experienced the true
        utilities of reliable tests and fast releases but it soon
        became clear to me how important these are to run a
        production system. I also learned the significance of close
        collaboration between development, testing and the release
        team which is absolutely essential to ensure that the
        incremental changes are rolled out in a smooth fashion. In
        Maurice Kherlakian’s words, <span class="emphasize"> “A
        phased approach to continuous delivery is not only
        preferable, it’s infinitely more manageable.” </span>
        </p>

        <p>
        After working at Sapient for 3 years, I wanted to increase
        my breadth in the field of Computer Science and I applied
        for a Master’s Degree at NYU. During my course projects, I
        tried to employ the same techniques I learned at Sapient to
        ensure that the incremental changes are tested and it
        allowed efficient collaboration with my peers. I did an
        internship at IBM where I worked on automation testing
        which was used to reliably test and release Db2 Data
        Warehouse functionalities specifically Snapshot Backup and
        Restore. Before my work, testing was done using shell
        scripts. I used a docker testing container which highly
        simplified the automation setup as it could be easily
        pulled on a new cluster to kickoff automation. During my
        internship, I realized that automating a process exposes
        the deficiencies of the underlying system pretty soon and
        incentivizes us to fix them. As Bill Gates said, <span
        class="emphasize"> “The first rule of any technology used in a
        business is that automation applied to an efficient operation will
        magnify the efficiency. The second is that automation applied to
        an inefficient operation will magnify the inefficiency.”</span>
        </p>

        <p>
        During my internship at IBM, I participated in a multi
        location Hackathon which involved live training provided by
        IBM software engineers from a variety of domains. We were a
        team of 5 people working on building an application for
        crowdfunding and crowdsourcing using blockchain technology.
        I got a chance to use the Continuous Delivery Pipeline on
        IBM Cloud to build and deploy the application code. Code
        commits by all team members were live within seconds which
        kept our code production ready. As Mike Miller also said,
        <span class="emphasize"> “Simply put, things always had to be
        in a production-ready state: if you wrote it, you darn well
        had to be there to get it running!”</span> Given the
        time crunch and lots of tasks to work on during a hackathon
        Devops practises saved a lot of time. We were able to test
        the flow of application easily from time to time. I was
        really fascinated by such tools which work seamlessly
        pushing incremental changes automatically after code
        commits.

        I feel that taking the Devops course will help me learn how
        to use Devops practices to produce a valuable product for
        the customers. Recent readings about Devops has made me
        develop a better understanding about it on the whole. I
        found the following Devops periodic table by xebialabs and am really
        excited to use some of the tools on a real project.[1]

        <p>
        This course also puts us in an environment where each team
        is focussing on a different aspect of DevOps, creating an
        environment like the one we experience in the software
        industry where everybody works towards a common goal. Such
        an environment stimulates a faster learning curve through
        collaboration resulting in a more reliable and sustainable
        software development.

            course website using DevOps principles. I am part of the deployment
            team and our goal is to create the deployment pipeline to automate
            deployment of course website on cloud or local machine.
