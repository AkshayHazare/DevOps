                 <p class="leadquote"> Week 4</p>
                 <p> We had a prelimary study of Django's design scope and
                   organizing structure, and start a basic demo by following
                   the official turtorial.

                 <p>
                   During the Study, I learnt a lot
                   from Django Design philosophies, it not only applies to
                   Django, but also for agile development.

                 <p> We had a prelimary study of Django's design scope and

                  <p>
                    We also implemented the data model, and register the
                    administration for the database. In django, the
                    administration site is simple and easy to set up.
