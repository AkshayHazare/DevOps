        <p>
          I first came across the term DevOps while I was working as a summer
          intern at CooperSurgical. I was assigned a project for which I was
          required to learn more about Docker and also use it. While I was doing
           my research and reading information related to Docker on various
           tutorial websites, I came across the term DevOps. I started to gather
            more information and I realized that the DevOps culture is something
             most orgranizations should adopt, if not all.

        The main characteristics of DevOps and what I think sets it apart from other practices:

        <ol class=“nested”>
          <li>Rapid Delivery</li>
          <li>Feedback</li>
          <li>Collaboration</li>
        </ol>

        Primitive software engineering practices have become outdated as
        software has become an integral part of every single business. What I
        realized after reading about DevOps is that orgranizations using a
        DevOps model will do much better than those not using one.

        I come across many interesting terms while reading articles on the
        internet and DevOps was one of such many terms. After some slight
        research on the internet, I didn't think about it until Professor
        Callahan mentioned that he planned to start a DevOps course in Spring
        2018. I decided to register for the course almost instantly.
        Not only is this a new course at NYU, but it is one of the few DevOps
        courses offered by universities in the USA. I strongly feel this course
        is essential in all universities as adopting the DevOps cultures needs a
         change in mindset. With DevOps, the quality of services that businesses
       provide to customers will definitely increase.
    </p>
    <p>
      By studying DevOps I hope to learn how to work on projects more
      efficiently and how to accelerate the process of product delivery by
      continously analyzing customer feedback and monitoring the system as a
      whole. I hope to learn more the DevOps culture and in the future hope to
      adopt the practice.
    </p>
    <p>After attending every lecture, whether it was taught by Prof Callahan or
      a guest lecturer, I realize the importance of DevOps and how necessary it
      is to boost productivity among businesses. The DevOps course felt like a
      journey with meeting new people from the software industry, attending
      their presentations, discussing problems every week during class with
      teammates and other classmates and presenting our own progress in class.
      This is exactly what made the class particularly special. We learnt from
      our mistakes as we moved through the course which was a new and exciting
      experience. I hope this course becomes a permanent part of NYU's list of
      courses.
