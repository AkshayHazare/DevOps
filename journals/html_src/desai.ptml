            What is DevOps?
        </p>
        <p>
    		DevOps brings together developers and operations, merging them into a single team, and driving them with the idea of mutual support.
			DevOps methodology allows delivering software frequently with minor iterable changes.
    	</p>

        <p>
    		DevOps enables the users to receive new features and updates frequently. The customers receive new features and bug fixes more often and the company becomes more competitive.
    	</p>

    	<p>
    		DevOps minimizes the chances of outrages. Even if the outrages do take place, everything can be fixed in a matter of a couple of minutes (sometimes in a matter of a single refresh) and the users wonâ€™t even notice that something is wrong.

            What I wish to gain and learn?
        </p>

        <p>
    		Exposure to lots of open source technologies. Since DevOps is all about integration and automation, I'm looking forward to putting the pieces together and make the real use of them.
    	</p>

    	<p>
    		With good knowledge on DevOps, we can propose solutions to make things easier, repeatable and qualitative.

            Week 2
        </p>

        <p>
    		In our class, we installed Docker and browesed throught our DevOps 
                website through a container created by us. What fascinates me is 
                how Docker is so much lighter than Virtualization. We create 
                separate containers and run various applications in them 
                independently on different operating systems and configurations.

            Week 3
        </p>

        <p>
    		During week 3, I was assigned the task of going through 
                different cloud platforms and selecting one most suitable 
                for our classwork. I am studying and comparing the 4 leading 
                cloud service providers: Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, 
                Google Cloud Services, and OpenStack. I will be comparing them 
                on various parameters to take an informed decision.
