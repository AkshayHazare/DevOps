                </h3>
                <p>
                    My internship experience at Amazon has taught me about how
                    important 'operations' are to a team.  Amazon emphasizes a
                    lot of importance on operations,  any small changes
                    observed in the critical parameters of a service is fixed
                    immediately.  At Amazon, the development and maintenance
                    of services is done by the same team.  By doing so we
                    could deliver the deliverables quickly and maintain the
                    services in a good state.
                    <br>
                    I was thrilled when I knew that Prof. Callahan introduced
                    'DevOps' course in Spring 2018.  I immediately
                    enrolled in it hoping to extend my knowledge on DevOps.
                    Now, I feel excited to develop a website "To Learn DevOps"
                    by learning and implementing DevOps.  The idea of
                    developing the website is a great idea as it emphasizes
                    that
                    <u>
                        DevOps is not a tool but a way of working and I am
                        looking forward to learn that!
