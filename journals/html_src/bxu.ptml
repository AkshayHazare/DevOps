          Brief Introduction
        </p>
        <p>
          My name is Bowei Xu and I am a graduate student pursuing Master
          degree of Computer Science in Tandon School of engineering. I am
          taking this course to learn about this popular software engineering
          culture and prepare for the future career. I am excited to learn
          about the history and motivation of this culture and what the
          benefits it could bring to our engineers. Also I would like to know
          the advantage and disadvantage compared to other engineering culture.
        </p>
        <p>
          And I do look forward to the whole-class project for excising so
          we can experience how powerful DevOps could be in real-world
          development progress.
        </p>

        <p>
          Week 4:
          <br/>
          We build the Team page for our team to provide all information on it.
          We present our new UI to the whole class and get suggestion from
          customers. And we also start tesing and immigrating the styles into
          original one.
        </p>
        <p>
          Week 5:
          <br/>
          We have almost finish the migration of style sheet this week and
          start working on the web reconstruction. A common header and footer
          that would be included in all pages are in working process now.

          We have finish the head, menu and subhead including files and the

        <p>
          Week 7:
          <br/>
            The cutover has been tested and finished on most main page and
            the feedback is pretty good so far. We keep helping people who have
            trouble cutting over this week. Documenting our designs and
            implementation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Week 8:
          <br/>
          Finish up the documentation and discuss with instructor and
          teammates about next steps. Start going through the websites
          and adjust stylesheet for unification. Planning on the tasks of
          nav bar automatic generation and DevOps news update.
        </p>
        <p>
          Week 9:
          <br/>
          Working on unifying the style through the website and also adjusting
          the space to fix some arrangement problem. Working with teammate
          on the automatic generation of navbar. The major function is almost
          done and further adjustment and test is in process.
        </p>
        <p>
          Week 10:
          <br/>
          Adjust and settle down the sample input file for the automatic
          generation. And my teammate and I have finished a original version
          which is going to further test. Also, we have a news bar released
          on the home page. The communication is still in research.
          I have finished a general walk through of the book "Lean Software
          Development: an Agile Tookit" and start writing review in details.
        </p>
        <p>
          Week 11:
          <br/>
          Improve the original menu automatic generation with recursive
          generation that can handle menu with different levels. Also we
          add the feature that the title and collapsed title can be also
          hanlded automatically by adding them into the input menu. The new
          version has been tested with the OOP site and the result is pretty
          positive.
        </p>
        <p>
          Week 12:
          <br/>
          We finish the module and script for the menu auto generation and we
          have documented the design, implementation and sample input for it.
          The corner case test is still in process. I have reviewed the first
          two toolkits in the book "Lean Software Development: an Agile Tookit"
          and summarize them into a brief introduction.
        </p>
        <p>
          Week 13:
          <br/>
          We are keep testing and add corner case check to the menu generation
          modules. And we also keep update the style sheet to arrange the pages
          better. I have focused more on the book review and finished the
          introduction and three toolkits in the chapter 3 of the book
          "Lean Software Development: an Agile Tookit" related to how to make
          decisions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Week 14:
          <br/>
          For this week, we start reviewing previous work and documenting
          missing components to winding up what we have done this semester.
          Also I focus on the reviews of the rest book and modify previous
          part to be more clear and professional.
        </p>
        <p>
