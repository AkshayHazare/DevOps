        <p>
            Being a cybersecurity major, I wanted to get a taste of software
            engineering. When the opportunity presented itself in the form of
            a DevOps course, I decided to take it. Security is being given
            more emphasis than ever in the software engineering lifecycle,
            and I felt I needed to learn more about being a part of it. In
            addition, I felt that the course would give me the necessary
            skills when I join the industry after I graduate.
        </p>
        <p>
            DevOps is where the industry is moving towards. Being a
            combination of Lean and Agile practices, DevOps enables the
            maximum utilization of the skills of a software engineering team.
        </p>
        <p>
            Started with the book review and reading up on automated tools
            for vulnerability analysis.
        </p>

        <h5>Epilogue</h5>
        <p>
            This course was one of the most industry facing courses I had 
            taken, and having taken in my last semester, the course did 
            prepare me and change my way of thinking. I grew more accustomed 
            to the DevOps way of thinking, and I slowly and unknowingly 
            started using the stratergy of short and frequent releases to my 
            other projects. I also got to takeaway a quick glimpse of the 
            various softwares and technologies that other teams used, and 
            through them I got to experience a little bit of all of the 
            softwares. I alone could not have covered so many softwares and 
            thought methodologies myself, and I wrap up this course much more 
            rugged than when I started it.
