                Week 12:
                <br>
                <br>
                In the final concluding week, I compiled the list
                of interview question. 

                Also finally I made a sample Jenkinsfile that can
                run if Jenkins is configured properly. 
                In order to keep the things simple I have kept
                3 stages build, test, deploy

                In order to generalize the users can then customize
                their steps.
            </p>
            <p>
                Week 11:
                <br>
                <br>
                In the previous week, I am reading about Docker
                compose and Dockerfile. The Docker becomes handy
                to package our application in a single Image and 
                we can port to any client. 

                Additionally, in the previous week I had a chance
                to interview with a startup regarding DevOps Engineer
                I will be shortly updating my blog over the devops
                engineering questions and links to study for the 
                same. 

                As we move to the final one week of the semester,
                I try to work on automating the build process and 
                provide a generalized template for Prof to use later
                on, for his new projects and other courses.
            </p>
            <p>
                Week 10:
                <br>
                <br>
                I am currently working on Jenkinsfile to improve the
                the automation of our builds.

                I have figured out a way in Jenkins which will able
                to build, test and deploy any commits made on our
                Github repository.

                The advantage of using this pipeline is that 
                the commits will be first be build in different
                Docker Containers then the different tests can
                be performed and once the tests passes the code
                can be deployed on our AWS servers
                
            </p>
            <p>
                Week 9:
                <br>
                <br>
                I have worked on finding different tools that developers
                use for build files.
                One of the tool is sonarqube that helps the build process
                relatively quicker. 
                It can be used with multiple technologies like Maven,
                Makefile, Apache ANT, etc

                I will write a review about the same in the upcoming 
                week. 
                Also I was working with Dockerizing a sample Flask Project
                with help of DockerBuild and DockerCompose files
            </p>
            <p>
                Week 8:
                <br>
                <br>
                The last week for more of an exploration and solving
                the problem of students having issues with make file
                Included a link for running and executing the make
                file on Windows Platform.

                The further iteration of make file where implemented.
            </p>
            <p>
                Week 7:
                <br>
                <br>
                Since the class faced the problem of updating submodule
                utils, I and Janeil worked together to change the make file

                The submodule were updated simply by changing directories to
                util (submodule). Then once inside the submodule a simple
                git submodule update.

                <br>
                <br>
                Additionally I am working on setting up a Jenkins server
                on Docker Images and then uploading on Kubernetes cluster
                This gave a nice exposure to different container
                orchestration tools like Kubernetes.
            </p>

            <p>
                Week 6:
                <br>
                <br>
                The spring break provided the perfect opportunity to explore
                learn and experinment new things.
                I enrolled in lynda.com's couse for Docker which explained
                the concepts of docker easily.
                The course gave me a quick idea of how efficient the
                use of Docker is. I am currently working to dockerize
                entire application which involves web-servers, database,
                load balances etc with the help of docker.
                As mentioned the last week's material, I was able to
                configure AWS EC2 instance using Terraform.

            </p>

            <p>
                Week 5:
                <br>
                <br>
                After attending Tom's Lecture, various aspects of DevOps
                were clearly stated. The best part of the entire talk
                according to me is how he explained DevOps using real
                life examples using different analogies(Punk Rock).
                The importance of increamental releases was realized
                in just not only the field of DevOps or Computer Science
                but also in normal day-to-day life.

                After attending the lecture I read quite lot of blogspot
                regarding system reliability and maintanence.
                The vital part in any robust system is replication and
                load balancing. Therefore I am trying to design a simple
                system with multiple replicated servers on AWS using
                configuration management tool such as Ansible or Teraform.
                Will update my assignment findings ASAP.

                Additionally, at my workplace I am trying to setup university
                wide Jenkins Tool over AWS.

                Since last Thursday,
                I developed a sample application to read data from Github,
                Slack, and other various sources and display it over
                the website. Soon a blog regarding how I did the
                same will be published.

                I realized the importance of Unit Testing and loggin
                while developing any application. Unit tests are critical
                which determines the robustness of the code. I learned
                few more thing about building efficient deployment
                cycles by first executing unit test, anazlying results
                and then automatic deployment process.

                At the devops side, I read about more and more built
                tool which are currently available for the disposal of
                developers. I have researched about
                PyBuilt which involves
                around Python Projects and
                Added review of PyBuilt in Built Section.

                We completed the proper installation
                of Docker and
                ran our DevOps website inside the new container
                that we created.
                It is just amazing to see how light Docker is
                from Virtualization.
                Insted of providing us with multiple operating systems,
                Docker
                provides us with container that can hold
                many applications.
                This is suitable for micro-services architecture.

                Being a graduate student, I always seek to gain
                maximum industry level exposure. Therefore, during summer
                2017 I interned as Academic Student Worker at
                NYU Information Technology. I developed plugin
                that aided faculty
                members to have an organized view of the
                students enrolled in their
                classes. I achieved this project by using
                newest technologies
                such as NodeJS, MongoDB and AWS to improve
                my learning curve.
                During the part of this internship, my mentors
                introduced me
                to the concept of DevOps. Lately, as agile
                team 4 developers
                and 3 student workers we tranformed the
                two of the most widely
                used services NYU Web Publishing and
                NYU Classes to perform in a
                DevOps based SCRUM environment. I came
                across variety of
                technologies such as Jenkins, Ansible, Maven
                that helped us
                with continuous integration. I am very
                much looking forward
                to start my career in this dynamic and
                exciting field.
