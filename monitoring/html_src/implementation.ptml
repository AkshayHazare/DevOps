                        <b>Step 1</b> : Sign Up for Google Analytics from
                        <a href="https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/provision/?authuser=0#provision/CreateAccount/">
                          here.</a> In this form , you need to fill up the
                          details about website.

                      <li>
                        <b>Step 2</b> : Once you are done signing up, you'll
                          get the Tracking ID. Along with the Tracking ID,
                          you'll also get Global Site Tag (gtag.js) tracking
                          code under PROPERTY. You need to put the code in
                          the HEAD-tag of all the webpages you want to track.
                          You can also add the code to some file and simply
                          include that file on all the webpages.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        <b>Step 3</b> : After adding the code to each and every
                        webpage you want to track, you should be able to see
                        data about your site in a couple of hours. You can see
                        Real-time data such as number of active users, their
                        locations, the device from which they are accessing the
                        website etc. Moreover, you can also see the reports of
                        user activity with respect to time for past week, month
                        and year. You can also see most frequently visited

                    <h4> Steps </h4>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            Login: The first step is to login to the
                            Status Cake Account.
                            To get the login details please contact Professor
                            Callahan.
                        </li>
                        <li>

                            on the menu on the left. Give a name for the
                            group. This group will be alerted in case
                            the website goes down.
                            There are different ways alerts  can be
                            received like email, mobile or using an
                            application. The next step explains how to
                            create the Slack Integration.

                        <li>
                          Slack: To receive alerts on a Slack channel we need
                          to integrate StatusCake with Slack. Generate a
                          webhook URL. Select slack as the 3RD party
                          integration. The Alias field cannot be left blank,
                          its necessary to fill the field.
