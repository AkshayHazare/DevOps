                      "Zabbix is an open source network monitoring tool that
                      works with a centralized Linux-based Zabbix server." <br/>
                      <i>-www.zabbix.com</i><br/>
                      "The Zabbix server automatically collects and parses data
                      from monitored hardware so administrators can check
                      availability and see trends in network performance.
                      The server communicates to the native software agents
                      that are available for many operating systems,
                      including Linux, UNIX and Windows.</br>
                      For operating systems without an agent, generic
                      monitoring protocols such as Simple Network Management
                      Protocol (SNMP) or Intelligent Platform
                      Management Interface (IPMI) can be used."</br>
