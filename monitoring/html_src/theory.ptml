                    Monitoring Theory
                </h1>

                <p>
                    Monitoring is a key part of DevOps because
                    monitoring is a source of feedback. Applications
                    now are more business critical than ever. An important 
                    part of DevOps is 
                    automation that has increased the productivity.
                    Now there are frequent code commits with
                    developers having to write comprehensive
                    automated tests for their code. Every time a
                    new commit occurs it automatically triggers all
                    the unit and integration tests. Because development
                    is striving more to use a production-like environment,
                    monitoring becomes important.


                    Monitoring provides feedback about the application’s
                    performance and usage patterns. This ensures the
                    health and the availability of our IT systems and
                    services. Effective monitoring is essential to
                    allow DevOps teams to deliver at speed,
                    get feedback from production, and
                    increase customers satisfaction, acquisition
                    and retention.

                    operations staff all need to ensure that their
                    internet and intranet mobile applications and web
                    applications are tested and operate successfully
                    from different points of presence around the world."

                    notifications and Slack messages when specific
                    situations or events occur in development, testing
                    or production environments, to get the right people’s

                    and deploy complex applications and configure them
                    in development, testing and production environments.
                    We will discuss the best practices for these teams to
                    collaborate effectively and efficiently and avoid
                    potential duplication and erroneous information."

                    patterns in log messages to identify if there is a
                    problem in the code. Operations need to do root cause
                    analysis across multiple log files to identify the
                    source of the problem in complex application and

                   " Fault Detection: The primary goal of monitoring
                    is to determine when a resource becomes unavailable
                    or starts to perform poorly. As soon as performance
                    and other issues arise rich diagnostic data is sent
                    back to the development teams.  This is the time to
                    detect(TTD). TTM is the time to mitigate these issues
                    by the DevOps teams. The time taken to mitigate the
                    issues are measured and are improved on. After
                    mitigation, teams work on finding the root cause of
                    the issue so that they do not occur again. This is
                    the time to remediate(TTR)."

                 "Validated Learning: A second goal is validated
                 learning by tracking usage. Every deployment is an
                 opportunity to track experimental results that support
                 or diminish the hypotheses that led to the deployment.
                 Tracking usage and differences between versions allows
                 teams to measure the impact of change and drive business
                 decisions. If a hypothesis is diminished, the team can
                 “fail fast” or “pivot”. If the hypothesis is supported,
                 then the team can double down or “persevere”.
                 These data-informed decisions lead to new hypotheses
                 and prioritisation of the backlog."
