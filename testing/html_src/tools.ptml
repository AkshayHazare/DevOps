                    It is essential to understand the difference between CI and CD
                    before we move to comparisons. <br> Continuous Integration (CI)
                    is about everyone merging code changes to a central repository
                    multiple times a day. "Each merge triggers an automated build
                    and testing sequence for the given project.
                    Continuous Delivery (CD) is a practice of automating the entire
                    software release process. The idea is to do
                    CI, plus automatically prepare and track a release to
                    production. The desired outcome is that anyone with sufficient
                    privileges to deploy a new release can do so at any time in one
                    or a few clicks. By eliminating nearly all manual tasks,
                    developers become more productive." (

                <b> We have chosen Jenkins as our continuous integration tool
                    because:
                <br />
                a) It gives us various options to customize with plugins
                <br />
                b) It is windows compatible
                (Many students in the class use the windows platform)
                <br />
                c) It has amazing amounts of resources and a great community
