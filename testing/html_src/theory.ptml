            <h2> What is Software Testing?</h2>
                <p>Definition: The process of Evaluation of a system and its 
                components with the intent of validating against specific
                requirements</p>

            <h2>When to start testing?</h2>
                <ul class="nested">
                    <li> Cost and rework is reduced when testing starts early in
                    the developement phase.</li>
                    <li> Testing can start from the requirement gathering phase to
                    the deployment phase.</li>
                    <li> Testing takes many forms and depends on the software 
                    development model.</li>
                </ul>

            <h2> Testing myths to overcome:</h2>
               <p>
                "Testing is too expensive.<br>
                Testing is time-consuming.<br>
                Only fully developed processes are tested.<br>
                A tested software is bug-free."<br>

            <ul class="nested">
            <li>
            Recognizing Faults : Errors can be in unit level or 
            system level. After going through testing the application will
            be free of errors.
            </li>

            <li>
            Enhancing Product Standards : With proper testing an application can
            be bug-free. This helps to build up ideal software for the end-users.
            </li>
            <li>
            Evaluating Credibility : If the software application has gone through
            all testing types
            (like unit testing, regression testing, smoke testing, etc.), 
            the application will
            be a reliable one.
