            <p>
              This book aims to introduce the toolkits for software
              development to go agile. It is expected to function as
              a guide book for all management levels to apply appropriate
              lean priciples to improve their various requirement. The author
              is trying to dig out the potential improvement for development
              process.
              <br />
              This book contains 22 thinking tools to help develop the agile
              practices that work best in all people's particular domains.
              These tools are summarized into 7 lean principals from which
              they are translated.

              These principles and its related toolkits are introduced in
              details one principle each chapter and provide
              practical suggestions for implementing the priciples and these
              toolkits. Very good book for workers in manager level.

                    Chapter 1: Eliminate Waste
                </summary>
                <p>
                  According to the author, This concept, Eliminate waste,
                  is first brought up by
                  Taiichi Ohno, known as the father of the Toyota Production
                  System, to deal with the conflict of market requirement and
                  manufacture cost. In this concept, he gives waste a new
                  definition "Anything that does not create value for a
                  customer is waste. A part that is sitting around waiting to
                  be used is waste. Making something that is not immediately
                  needed is waste. Motion is waste. Transportation is waste.
                  Waiting is waste. Any extra processing steps are waste.
                  And of course defects are waste"[2]. The core of his ideal is
                  that immediate production delivery is better than inventory.
                  The history has proven the validity of his idea and this
                  concept is becoming the most fundamental lean principles that
                  all other principles should follow from.
                </p><br />
                <p>
                  Then the authors give us a guide on how to implement
                  the principals by introducing two toolkits.
                  The first toolkit, also should be the first step is
                  learning to see waste. If a thing can't
                  contribute to customer's perception or there is a way to go
                  around it, it is waste. By this definition, Windston Royce
                  had seen all steps besides coding and analysis are waste to
                  development in 1970[3]. The authors metion this because it is
                  a good start to re-evalue steps in development waterfall
                  process. Then the authors translates the 7 wastes of
                  manufacturing identified by Shigeo into 7 corresponding
                  wastes in software development: partially done work, extra
                  process, extra features, task switching, waiting, motion,
                  defects[4]. Although items like management, project tracking
                  would not directly contribute to the production process,
                  they are still very important because wastes mentioned above
                  can be minimized by these systems.
                </p><br />
                <p>
                The second step(toolkit) of implementation introduced by the
                author is value stream mapping. The author bring up the
                comparison between traditional development process and agile
                development by value stream map. It is very obvious that
                where the delays and waste are in process.
                From this, we are well acknowledged of the power of the value
                stream map. It is very helpful for management level to take an
                overall view of the process and uncover all hidden waste which
                should be eliminated. A value stream map is also a effective
                tool that development team can acknowledge the biggest
                opportunities to deliver value and expediate the workflow.
                The author also give an simplified action model to create
                and apply the value stream map in the last part of this
                section.

                    Chapter 3: Decide as late as possible
                </summary>
                <p>
                  So in this part, the authors brings up the priority of
                  concurrent development over sequatial development and
                  what is "decide as late as possible"[5] and why. They start
                  with the comparison of cost of adapting changes to die design
                  in American and Japanese car production process in 80s last
                  century. The cost in Japan is much lower not due to a better
                  original design but because they are using a more
                  efficient and change-tolerance method, concurrent process.
                  And same in software development, programing has shown great
                  improvement after switching to concurrent development[6].
                  Instead of traditional depth-first design that constrains
                  high-level and low-level decisions together,
                  the new developemt applies breadth-first approach in design
                  that high-level problem or changes can be adapted with much
                  less cost since breadth-first method allow engineers
                  to consider most options so inevitable changes or problems
                  can be found and worked out as soon as
                  possible which will overal cost much less time in deliverying
                  the final product. Also, the design of
                  a product should be more flexible to accept possible changes
                  that could occur in development process or after release to
                  avoid cost escalation since software is something need
                  lifetime upgrade. Decide as late as possible could help
                  with it since it could help minimized the high-stake
                  constrains and apply breadth-first approach to make them as
                  correct as possible. It also can reduce the decisions number
                  leading to changes and the cost escalation factor for
                  changes. So using concurrent development and decide as late
                  as possible help reduce the cost by minimize the constrains
                  of a product to accept changes and reduce the changes cost.
                </p><br />
                <p>
                  The first tool introduced in this part is options thinking.
                  As mentioned by the authors, the attraction of satisfication
                  guaranteed warranties is that irrevocable decision is not
                  preferred by people when there is uncertainty. They use HP
                  printer sales as a good example of how delay decisions helps
                  in this condition that they make the electrical configuration
                  of their printers after the orders are made so there could be
                  adjustment among countries with different configuration.
                  This is called "option open"[7] that delay the decision
                  that make less constrains on options until the uncertainty
                  gone. Another example given is the Microsoft which
                  also gambled in options by providing several systems that
                  allow them to hold most options in market to reduce risk. And
                  same in software development, minimize the options limit by
                  delaying decisions until the customer requirement is clear
                  or mature technology has been achieved would reduce cost in
                  future changes or adjustment. However, the authors emphasize
                  that options thinking is not something guaranteeing success
                  but move the development into a favorable direction when
                  there is uncertainty. To well apply it, engineer must be
                  experienced and research much to decide which options
                  should be open instead of keeping everything open.
                </p><br />
                <p>
                  The second tool is the last responsible moment. According to
                  previous approach, concurrent development allow delay
                  commitment but the delay has to be a deadline. The last
                  responsible moment is the toolkit to help make decisions.
                  It is the due date that commitments have to be made to
                  eliminate other important alternatives, or decisions would be
                  made by default[8]. The authors shows several practical
                  tactics to help. These tactics not only
                  help make decision before the last responsible moment but
                  also teach us how to decide and improve the last
                  responsible moment, such as "share partially complete design
                  information", "organize for direct, worker-to-worker
                  collaboration", "develop a sense of how to absorb changes"[9]
                  and etc..
                </p><br />
                <p>
                  The third tool is making decisions. In this part, the authors
                  have summarized some components in previous tools and talk
                  about approaches in decision making. First, they talk about
                  the comparison between depth-first approach and breadth-first
                  one as mentioned in the first tool and claim their advantages
                  and risk and see conidtions which approach should be applied.
                  Breath-first approach is normally the more effective one
                  since it has less limitaion and requirement. Then talk
                  about the intuitive decision making compared to rational
                  decision making. It is actually pretty surprising that
                  intuitive decision making performs better in most conditions
                  that high-stakes mistakes is more likely detected because
                  rational decision would suffer tunnel version and timing.
                  The authors have given examples in fire department and
                  the Marines to support this opinion which is pretty
                  convincing. At last, the author clarify that the rules that
                  decision making follows must be simple. Simple rule can
                  help well in flexibility, robustness and
                  self-organization[10]. It allows people to act quickly
                  without waiting and as mentioned before, quicker
                  action/response allows later decision making.

                    Chapter 5: Empower the team
                </summary>
                <p>
                  This chapter start to talk about the toolkits to improve the
                  satification and manufacture efficiency. The authors start
                  his point by going back to the historical period that
                  traditional scientific management start turning from a
                  impressive method to a source of dissatification in the
                  industry and being challenged by the
                  lean development method. After several failed reformative
                  versions, people realized that it's time to make essential
                  changes. After some exploration, the idea "moving decisions
                  to the lowest possible level in an organization while
                  developing the capacity of those people to make decisions
                  wisely"[11] has been raised and accepted. Empower is proved
                  to be a very good method to keep workers motivated and
                  improve the efficiency. CMMI, an advanced verison of CMM, is
                  introduced as a successful mature management tool applying
                  the above principals[11].
                </p><br />
                <p>
                  The first tool introduced to empower the team is
                  self-determination. The autors raise the sample that NUMMI
                  (New United Motor Manufacturing)[12] turned a disaster plant
                  into one of the highest productive plant in the US. It turns
                  out the crux of previous disaster is "the workers did not
                  appreciate being told how to do their jobs."[13] which lead
                  to the lack of motivation. The secret is the toolkit which
                  is gonna be introduced in this part, self-determination that
                  workers are trained to make decition themselves and work in
                  team made of workders instead of being commanded by manager.
                  The author using this sample to claim that let workers
                  decide by themselves instead of told by higher level people
                  who is less experienced can fully inspire their capability
                  and motivation. The author also clarify in a easily
                  understood words, "Treat People Like Volunteers"[14].
                </p><br />
                <p>
                  The second toolkit followed is motivation. "Passion and
                  camaraderie create an intense atmosphere in which anything
                  is possible"[15], the author descript so to indicate the
                  importance of the motivation. Using the example of 3M, the
                  author shows us the spirit that keep the company growing
                  larger and fast. The leader of this company raised great
                  opinions that leads the company culture, such as “Hire good
                  people, and leave them alone”, “If you put fences around
                  people, you get sheep. Give people the room they need”[16].
                  Expanding from this example, the authors present us the
                  advantage of motivation and what we should do to help
                  accomplish the purpose of motivation since people
                  should not follow any purpose unachievable just due to
                  motivation. The authors gives us detailed description of
                  how to build motivation correctly and what are necessary
                  to keep it going.
                </p><br />
                <p>
                  Good motivation and purpose need good team to push it forward
                  and a team leader is a key component of a good team. So the
                  third toolkit given is leadership. In this part, the authors
                  introduce the personality and ability that a leader should
                  maintain and where the leadership should fit in in
                  development process.
                </p><br />
                <p>
                  The last toolkit in this part is expertise. With only
                  motivation and leadership, work won't work well unless
                  people on their work have related expertise. The authors
                  present the example of Nucor and Xerox to show how helpful
                  workers' expertise related to their responsibility would be.
                  From these examples, we can tell that it is important for
                  team and company to address expertise level of workers and
                  put them on right duty.

                "A system is not just the sum of its parts—it is the product
                of their interactions"[17], the author starts this section by
                the definition of what is a system. According to them, system
                thinking is the way that consider a organization consisting of
                parts working together systematically. The authors believe that
                it would be a good way to predict difficulties and problems
                by applying system thinking to create simulation based on a
                organization's agreement and policies since any problems
                confront could also be predictable in the organization. Then
                the authors introduced three basic patterns: limits to
                growth[18], shifting the burden[19] and suboptimization. All
                these patterns are to help solve underlying problems from the
                very root instead of just fixing the symptoms to make things
                worse.
