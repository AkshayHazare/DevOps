                provide support to development of Linux kernel. Though, it has
                also been resourceful to a variety of projects. Git was invented
                to add features like Facilitate Distributed Development, Scale
                to Handle Thousands of Developers, Perform Quickly and Efficiently, 
                Maintain Integrity and Trust, Enforce Accountability, Immutability,

                <p>
                Git isn't preinstalled in any GNU/ Linux distribution or any 
                other operating system. To use Git, we need to explicitly 
                install it, depending on our local OS. Git is offered as 
                a bunch of packages, and every individual package can be 
                installed separately based on our requirement. For every 
                OS, we need to find the appropriate package to use to their 
                native package member to install the software. Like any 
                other open source software, Git needs to be configured 
                before running the made command and then finally be 
                installed.

                This chapter discusses the simplicity in using Git Command Line. 
                Just the command 'git' lists all the options and sub commands 
                available. Stp by step guide to create an Initial Repository, 
                adding files to that repository, configuring the commit author, 
                making another commit, viewing your commits, viewing commit 
                differences, removing and renaming files in your repository, 
                making a copy of your repository, configuring files, configuring 
                an ALias, etc has been given. We simply need to run those 
                commands to get the initial hands on experience of using Git 
                command line.

                In this chapter, the author examines the key components of Git's 
                architecture and other important concepts. The concept of 
                repositories is discussed, followed by Git Object types like 
                Blobs, trees, commits, tags, etc. The concept of Index is 
                discussed next. Index is a temporary and dynamic binary file 
                that describes the directory structure of the entire repository. 
                Some other features of Git are discussed like Content Addressable 
                Names, Git Tracks Content, difference between pathname and 
                content, pack files, object store pictures, etc.

                This chapter discusses about the classification of files in 
                Git. Git classifies your files into three main categories: 
                Tracked files, ignored files, and untracked files. Tracked 
                files are the files which are already added in the repository 
                or files that are staged in the index. Ignored files have to 
                be explicitly declared invisible or ignored in the repository, 
                inspite of being present within the working directory. 
                Untracked files are any files which aren't tracked or ignored. 
                The 'git add' command is used to stage a file or directory of 
                files. 'Git commit' is used to stage unstaged, tracked file 
                changes. 'Git status' shows what a regular commit would do. 
                'Git rm' is the natural inverse of 'git add'. It removes the 
                file from the repository as well as the working directory.

                </summary>
                <p>
                Commits are used to record changes made to a repository in Git. 
                Each Git commit refers to a single, atomic changeset with 
                respect to the previous state. Commit snapshots are chained 
                together, where each new snapshot points to its predecessor. 
                A sequence of changes is thus represented as a series of 
                commits, over a period of time. Git is flexible to frequent 
                commits and offers a huge set of commands to work with. Each 
                small, well-defined commit can lead to better organization of 
                modifications and easy manipulation of patch sets.

                <p>
                A branch refers to a new series of development within the 
		existing project. It is a split from a unified stage, which 
		allows continued development in many parallel directions, which 
		may later lead to production of numberous versions of the same 
		project. A branch usually merges with the other branches towards 
		the end. The default branch is called master, and it usually 
		contains the more robust line of development. It is introduced 
                by Git during the repository initialization. Heirarchical branch 
                names can be used to enable categorized organization and 
                scalability.

                A diff refers to a brief summary of the differences between two 
                objects. For example, if we consider two text files, diff will 
                compare them line by line and show the deviations. While diff 
                shows the differences, it shows no reason for justifying the 
                changes. However, it doess offer a formal description on how 
                one file can be transformed into another.

                </summary>
                <p>
                Git is a Distributed Version Control System, and thus allows 
                developers in different cities or even countries to work 
                independently and commit their respective changes. It also 
                permits them to merge their work whenever needed without the 
                need of a central repository. A merge unifies multiple commit 
                history branches. This merge must occur within a single 
                repository. When there are no conflicts between the modifications 
                in different branches, Git creates a merge result and a new 
                commit representing the merge is created. However, when there is 
                a conflict in the modifciations, Git does not resolve the issue. 
                Rather, it leaves the merge to the users. It is upto the user to 
                make a final commit when all the conflicts are resolved. During a 
                merge, Git generates new versions of the files in the working 
                directory once finished. Git makes use of index to store the 
                intermediate versions of files during operations.

                <p>
                A commit maintains the history of one's work, but the commit 
                itself isn't saved as immutable. Git offers various tools and 
                commands designed specially to aide us edit and improve the 
                commit history. One may want to modify their commit to prevent 
                a problem from becoming a legacy, to break down a large change 
                into smaller chunks of modifications, or to combine a number 
                of small changes to a big commit, to add review feedback and 
                suggestions, to reorder the commits in a more logical sense, 
                and to remove debug code committed accidentally. The simplest 
                way to modify the recentmost commit is using git commit --amend. 
                The 'amend' indicates that the fundamental content is the same, 
                but some adjustment is required. Another use is to fix typos or 
                errors immediately post commit.     </p>

                A remote is a reference to another repoitory. A repository can 
                have any number of repositories and have a vast network of 
                repository sharing. A local repository is created by cloning 
                the master repository. Once the repository is created, you 
                can update and edit it by using pull and push, respectively. 
                One should regularly update their local repository from the 
                master to maintain syncronization. In order to keep a check 
                on other repositories using tracking branches. You can share 
                your repository with others by publishing it. Git provides 
                several ways for doing so.

                </summary>
                <p>
                There are two main approaches to repository management. One 
                focusses on centralizing the repository while the other 
                focusses on distributing it. For instance, if one is working 
                on a centralized repository, every contributor to that repository 
                has a complete, private copy of that repository and can work in 
                an independent and parallel manner. All the work is managed 
                through a central repository which is shared. Many version 
                control systems make use of a centralized server in order to 
                maintain a repository. On the other hand, larger projects often 
                follow a distributed development model, which comprises of 
                a centralized, yet logically segmented repository. This 
                repository is segmented logically. Hence, even though it 
                exists as a singly physical entity, logical proportions 
                are assigned to different teams or people who work 
                independently.

                Git lets development work to be transferred between different 
                repositories directly and instantly using the push and pull model. 
                Various people clone a repository and work independently and push 
                commits. Finally, they share their modifications with the other 
                collaborators. Patches are sent via emails, thus each recipient 
                may chose to apply all, some, or none of the patches. Patches are 
                used for two main reasons: Git native protocols and HTTP protocol 
                can't be used for data exchange between repositories in the 
                direction of either pull or push, and patches allow collaboration 
                in a peer-to-peer development. Before making the patches permanent, 
                other collaborators can discuss and review, and may give a red or 
                green signal.

                </summary>
                <p>
                Git hooks are used to run one or more arbitrary scripts on 
                account of a patch or commit occuring in the repository. 
                Usually, an event is broken down into a number of prescribed 
                steps, and we can tie up a customized script to each step. An 
                appropriate script is called on even of the outset of every step. 
                A hook runs in context of either the current local repository or 
                the remote repository. Moreover, hooks can be categorized into 2 
                main categories: a 'pre' hook runs before the completion of an 
                action. Such hooks can be used to approve, reject, or update a 
                modification before being applied. On the other hand, the 'post' 
                hooks run after the completion of an action. It triggers 
                notifications or launches required processing.

                Combining projects can be achieved by importing the code into 
                our projects. By doing this, one wont have the incorrect library 
                version by mistake. The entire process is pretty easy and only 
                requires basic knowledge of Git. This process is also independent 
                of the version control system used. And finally, the repository 
                is always complete and thus, a clone consists of everything one 
                may need.
