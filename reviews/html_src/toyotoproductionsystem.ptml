                  <b><u> Book Review: </u></b> <br>
                  Are you interested to work in an automobile industry or
                  setup your own automobile industry like Elon Musk, this is
                  the right book to read.   Be a little cautious if you are
                  thinking about doing the later as the automobile industry in
                  USA is very heavily crowded. <br> <br>

                  This book talks about the great success of Toyota Production
                  Systems which was developed and promoted by Toyota Motor
                  Corporation and is being adopted by many Japanese companies
                  and US companies in the aftermath of the 1973 oil shock.
                  The main purpose of the system is to eliminate through
                  improvement activities various kinds of waste lying
                  concealed within a company. <br> <br>

                  The author starts of his first chapter by primarily focusing
                  on various important aspects on which total framework of the
                  Toyota production systems lies on. He highlights topics such
                  as primary purpose, kanban systems, production smoothing,
                  shortening setup time, process layout for shortened lead
                  times and one-piece production, standardization of
                  operations, autonomation, improvement activities, the Goal
                  of TPS. Later in the first section of his book, he talks
                  about how Toyota achieved its primary goal of profit through
                  cost reduction by employing good strategies like elimination
                  of overproduction, limiting excess inventory and
                  overproduction, reducing unnecessary capital investments. <br> <br>
