                  <b><u> Book Review: </u></b> <br>
                  Are you interested to work in an automobile industry or
                  setup your own automobile industry like Elon Musk, this is
                  the right book to read!   Be a little cautious if you are
                  thinking about doing the later as the automobile industry in
                  USA is very heavily crowded. <br> <br>

                  After 1973 oil crisis imposed by Organization of Arab
                  Petroleum Exporting Countries, Toyota Productions systems
                  implemented and promoted a Toyota Productions Framework.
                  "The main purpose of the system is to eliminate through
                  improvement activities various kinds of waste lying
                  concealed within a company." (page 3)<br> <br>

                  The author starts of his first chapter by primarily focusing
                  on various important aspects on which total framework of the
                  Toyota production systems lies on. He highlights topics such
                  as primary purpose, kanban systems, production smoothing,
                  shortening setup time, process layout for shortened lead
                  times and one-piece production, standardization of
                  operations, autonomation, improvement activities, the Goal
                  of TPS. Later in the first section of his book, he talks
                  about how Toyota achieved its primary goal of profit through
                  cost reduction by employing good strategies like elimination
                  of overproduction, limiting excess inventory and
                  overproduction, reducing unnecessary capital investments. <br> <br>

                  In the second section of his book, the author talks about
                  all the subsystems of Toyota production systems which should
                  function effectively to achieve all the goals prescribed in
                  the first section of his book.  He talks about introduction
                  of supplier kanban, smoothed production, information system
                  for supply chain management in depth.  Concepts like 5S
                  concept which is used to manage slack in an automobile
                  company, shortening of production time, standard operating
                  procedures and machine layout are very centric to automobile
                  industries.  A person from another industry may not find it
                  very useful knowing in depth about these concepts but it
                  would little useful to know the summary of these concepts
                  as these concepts can be generalized and used everywhere in
                  the world.  One of the best chapters of this book is about
                  “One-Piece Production”, the author describes it as “the
                  concept of having things flow smoothly through the factory
                  one by one, like water, without any holdups” (page 161).
                  One-Piece Production can also be implemented in software
                  engineering with little modifications and it would have a
                  very good positive effect on the quality of software
                  delivered.  I personally feel that One-Piece Production has
                  few traits of waterfall model of software development. <br> <br>

                  Section three of this book was quantitively approached.  The
                  author states few terms like Sequencing method, Goal Chasing
                  method I & II, computing number of kanbans, he gives
                  formulas to compute those terms quantitively.  He gives us
                  very good examples of his own or detailed study of Toyota
                  companies for each term used and that makes it very easy to
                  understand those terms and their usage.  Last section of
                  this book deals with management of human resources.  Few
                  concepts like “Kaizen Mindset” are very well explained by
                  the author.  He later talks about various topics relating to
                  improvement of workforce and reduction of workforce and
                  autonomation of several tasks. <br> <br>

                  This book is a very good book to know about various
                  subsystems of an automobile industry.  The author states
                  the concepts theoretically and complements it with a
                  detailed case studies of any of the Toyota companies or
                  some made-up examples for easy understanding.  It is little
                  difficult to create any analogies between automobile
                  industry and IT industry for few of the concepts of this
                  book otherwise it is a good book to read and know about
                  various processes of an automobile industry. <br> <br>
