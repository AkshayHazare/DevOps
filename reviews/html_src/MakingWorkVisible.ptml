                    In Part 1 of the book, The author
                    talks about the 5 Thieves of Time:<br>
                <ul class="nested">
                    <li>Too much work-in-progress (wip)<br>
                    Trying to parallelize work or multitasking is not a 
                    beneficial approach as maintaing synchronisation
                    leads to undue loss of time.
                    </li>

                    <li>Unknown Dependencies<br>
                    Always know beforehand the set of things you need
                    to finish a task at hand.
                    </li>

                    <li>Unplanned Work<br>
                    Plan of action is the key to tackle any task as it 
                    keeps you in the right direction.
                    </li>

                    <li>Conflicting Priorities<br>
                    When handling a task ensure to priorities its components
                    as it saves time over continuing from a checkpoint.
                    </li>

                    <li>Neglected Work<br>
                    Ensure that you understand the scope of the task 
                    at hand to avoid future surprises.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    In Part 2 of the book, The author
                    talks about How to expose Time Theft
                    to optimize Workflow:<br>
                <ul class="nested">
                    <li>Make Work Visible<br>
                    Here she talks about ensuring that all your tasks are 
                    well documented and clear to you.
                    </li>

                    <li>Ambush the Ringleader<br>
                    Always try to tackle the core(connective) task to
                    multiple other tasks
                    </li>

                    <li>Exposed Dependencies<br>
                    Mark down clear dependecies i.e Tasks that are dependent 
                    on other tasks
                    </li>
                
                    <li>Committing the perfect crime - Unplanned Work<br>
                    Never approach your tasks without a plan of action 
                    as that can lead to confusion and chaos.
                    </li>

                    <li>Prioritize Prioritize Prioritize<br>
                    Always approach your tasks with decreasing order 
                    of priority.
                    </li>

                    <li>Preventing Negligence<br>
                    Ensure that critical tasks are not ignored and all 
                    work is chalked out effectively.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                    In Part 3 of the book, The author
                    talks about How to use Metrics, Feedback and
                    Circumstances to optimize Workflow:<br>
                <ul class="nested">
                    <li>Treat Metrics as Money<br>
                    Metrics are ver important and must be expended miserly
                    </li>

                    <li>The time Thief o'gram<br>
                    Try new ways to visualize the time at disposal and tasks 
                    at hand

                    <li>Operations review<br>
                    Review a task before adding them to the completion bucket
                    </li>
                
                    <li>The art of the meeting<br>
                    Meeting are an important part of workflow and should 
                    be dealt in an organized fashion
                    </li>
                
                    <li>Beastly Practices<br>
                    All events at hand must be handled like a beast with 
                    complete attention paid to tasks at hand.

                    Conclusion:
                    Dominica starts by exposing the five time thieves and
                    detailing how they keep us busy and overcommited while
                    allowing critical work to fall by the wayside. It is in
                    this section that Dominica describes tech debt work (work
                    that has accumulated due to short cuts, deferred 
                    maintenence, the passage of time, or other point in 
                    time decisions) as revenue protection. <br>

                    For me, this was a criticial connection. In the DevOps
                    and Digital Transformation discussion, we look at how
                    we can relate our development and IT operations work to
                    customer value. What we often have a hard time voicing is
                    how to fit those tech debt tasks into that value stream.
                    When we look at it from a perspective of revenue 
                    protection, (keeping services available, responsive, 
                    and secure helps keep customers ya know..), it becomes 
                    evident that those tasks need to be represented in the 
                    work we are doing. <br>

                    Another major takeaway for me was in the focus on the
                    metrics of the flow of work. Dominica dives in to a
                    variety of metrics that can be gleaned from using Kanban
                    and, more importantly, what those metrics mean for the
                    flow of work through the organization. <br>


                    I would most definitely recommend this book as it holds 
                    principles of time management which could be applied 
                    not only to the work life but also to private life for 
                    effective task/time management.
