                This book recommends best practises for continuous, reliable
                and efficient software delivery. The goal is to deliver value
                to the customer as early as possible and get faster feedback.
                It talks about ways to reduce time and risks associated with
                new versions of software. It describes the ways to make
                delivery reliable, visible and automated using a deployment
                pipeline. It highlights the importance of collaboration among
                the people responsible for delivering software and how they
                can get involved effectively to achieve the goals.

                The authors start by illustrating their goal building a
                deployment pipeline, which is an automated implementation of
                the applicationâ€™s build, deploy, test, and release process.
                They discuss the common antipatterns prevalent in software
                releases today, and the benefits of their approach. They also
                briefly discuss that to achieve their goal, the software needs
                to be frequently and automatically released. Finally they
                discuss some of the principles of software delivery like
                reliable releases, automation, version control, continuous
                improvement etc.

                </summary>
                <p>
                The authors describe Configuration Management as
                the process by which all relevant artifacts for a project and
                the relationship between them are stored, retrieved, uniquely
                identified and modified. They highlight how version control
                fosters collaboration among teams distributed in space and
                time. The authors recommend checking in everything in trunk on
                a regular and frequent basis and oppose the practice of using
                branches. The authors also emphasize the importance of testing
                and proper management of configurations. They stress the
                importance of managing the environment by creating a fully
                automated process. Thus they try to highlight the importance
                of configuration management which is the foundation for
                continuous integration, release management and deployment
                pipeline.

                <p>
                The goal of continuous integration is that the
                software is in a working state all the time. The teams that
                use continuous integration effectively are able to deliver
                software much faster, with fewer bugs, than teams that do not.
                Bugs are caught much earlier in the delivery process when they
                are cheaper to fix, providing significant cost and time
                savings.  The authors describe how to implement continuous
                integration by discussing the prerequisites and how to get
                started by setting up the CI server. They also discuss tools
                like Maven and Ivy to help manage third-party dependencies of
                the development workspace. They describe continuous
                integration as a software that can execute a workflow at
                regular intervals and provide a detailed view of success and
                failures of the builds and tests. The authors then discuss
                essential practices to make continuous integration
                effective.
                Thus authors point out that an established CI system is a
                foundation on which more infrastructure can be built. It
                provides visibility by aggregating the build information to
                provide high quality feedback and can be extended to do
                push-button deployments.

                </summary>
                <p>
                This chapter focuses on the planning and impementation of
                effective automation testing systems and their benefits.
                The authors encourage writing testing scripts from the
                beginning of the project and running them within the
                deployment pipeline which is triggered whenever any change
                is made to the application. They describe the different types
                of tests in detail like acceptance tests, unit tests,
                component tests and deployment tests. Manual testing
                techniques like showcases, usability testing and exploratory
                testing are important to build quality. They talk about modern
                automated functional testing tools like Cucumber, JBehave,
                Concordion and Twist and their benefits. They describe the
                process by which testing strategy can be implemented by
                bringing together all the stakeholders to note down the
                highest priority scenarios every iteration and then building
                automation for them.
                Thus authors highlight that automation testing should be
                included from the beginning to develop a feedback loop which
                generates higher quality, higher productivity and also the
                measure of the doneness of the project.

                </summary>
                <p>
                The authors describe deployment pipeline as the process of
                automating the build, deploy, test, and release process to
                deliver the feature from check-in to release. They describe
                the different stages of deployment pipeline and the best
                practices which should be followed in each of those stages.
                They also describe the steps to implement a deployment
                pipeline. Feedback is important in software delivery and can
                be measured by various metrics. The authors suggest having a
                global metric like cycle time to measure feedback and its
                measurement should be simple and made visible to discover
                bottlenecks. Thus the deployment pipeline should help in
                discovering which check-ins have caused issues and should
                allow everyone involved in software delivery to get visibility
                into the progress of builds.

                </summary>
                <p>
                The authors describe the techniques of creating an
                automated build and deployment process. They categorize
                the build tools into task oriented and product oriented
                tools describing their properties and the principles common
                to all the build and deployment tools.
                They also describe the advantages and disadvantages of some
                commonly used build tools like Make, Ant, Maven, Rake,
                Buildr. They discuss some of the best practices commonly
                used in the deployment setup for any application.
                The standard project layout used by Maven is described
                which gives a good idea for structuring any application.
                The strategies and best practices to solve common build and
                deployment problems  are discussed. The authors emphasize
                that the deployment scripts should be version-controlled,
                maintained, tested, and refactored and should be the only
                way to deploy the software.

                </summary>
                <p>
                In this chapter authors describe the commit stage which is 
                the first stage of the deployment pipeline and discuss about 
                creating effective commit tests. They describe the principal 
                goal of the commit stage which is either to create deployable 
                artifacts or fail fast and notify the developers of a concise 
                summary of the reasons for the failures showing a list of 
                failed tests, the compile errors or other error conditions.
                They describe some of the best practices used in commit stage 
                like when to break the commit stage, constantly improve the 
                commit stage scripts, give developers ownership and use build
                master in large teams. They discuss about storing the output 
                of the commit stage in an artifact repository. They describe 
                the principles of the commit test suite and the strategies 
                that can be used to run tests quickly. They also recommend 
                using mocking toolset and discuss an example based on open 
                source mock system called JMock. Thus the establishment of a 
                commit stage launched on every change, that builds binaries, 
                runs automated tests and generates metrics is important to 
                adopt the practice of continuous integration.

                </summary>
                <p>
                The authors discuss the importance of acceptance tests within
                the deployment pipeline. They describe how acceptance
                tests are different from unit or component tests, the former
                being more business focused. In their experience, the cost of
                creating and maintaining automated acceptance tests is much
                lower than repetitive manual and regression testing. They
                also discuss how to implement and maintain effective 
                acceptance tests with code examples. They describe the 
                principles and practices that should be used in the 
                acceptance test stage. They also discuss the benefits of 
                making the delivery team that includes developers and 
                testers, owners of the automated acceptance tests. Lastly,
                they describe the techniques which can improve the 
                performance of the acceptance test suite.

                </summary>
                <p>
                In this chapter authors discuss nonfunctional requirements 
                specifically capacity testing. They start by discussing the 
                importance of nonfunctional requirements, how to analyze them 
                and how to measure capacity. Then they describe how to create 
                the capacity testing environment to conduct the measurements. 
                They recommend creating a replica of production environments 
                for the applications in which performance is a serious concern.
                They discuss the strategies for creating capacity tests from 
                the automated acceptance test suite which represent realistic 
                scenarios to obtain comprehensive, maintainable coverage of the
                system. They recommend adding nonfunctional testing as a
                separate stage into the deployment pipeline. Lastly, they 
                discuss some additional benefits of using a capacity testing 
                system and call it an invaluable resource.

                </summary>
                <p>
                In this chapter, the authors focus on the differences between 
                deploying the software in a testing environment and releasing 
                it in the production, supported by an interesting example of 
                the test and release process diagram. They have discussed about
                two effective strategies to ensure zero-downtime releases and 
                rollbacks: blue-green deployments and canary releasing. A 
                critical stress has been put on the suggestion of 'not' 
                subverting the processes in case of emergency fixes. They 
                define that the aggressive approach of directly deploying 
                changes to the production environment in case of an emergency 
                fix might lead to severe consequences like introducing new 
                issue due to the incompatibility of the changes made, and also,
                the environment might move to unknown state due to unregistered
                changes and make it impossible to reproduce. Lastly, they refer
                to few tips and tricks like encouraging the people who are 
                involved in deployment should be involved in creating the 
                deployment process and techniques, every activity should be 
                registered, avoid deleting the old file and rather relocate 
                them. Most importantly, release planning is getting the 
                representatives from every part of your organization involved 
                in the delivery and these people should continue to meet 
                throughout the life of the project and continually work to make
                the delivery process more efficient.

                <p>
                The authors of the chapter review the first step of deploying 
                software as discussed in Chapter 1 of this book, that is, 
                creating and managing the infrastructure in which the 
                application will run. There are two attributes which describe 
                any environment, first, The hardware configuration of the 
                servers that form the environment (CPUs, amount of memory, 
                spindles, NICs, etc.) and secondly, The configuration of the 
                operating system and middleware (such as messaging systems, 
                application and web servers, database servers) required to 
                support the applications that will run within it. The authors
                also explain how the needs of the operation team and state 
                that the group or stakeholder management plays an important 
                role in the success of any project. To explain the concept of 
                managing server provisioning and configuration, they have 
                provided various examples and puppet configuration for 
                multiple modules. To deal with problems due to different 
                servers, they have introduced the concept of virtualization and
                discussed its benefits like fast-response to the changing 
                environment, standardized hardware, ease of managing the 
                baselines, etc. In the end, the authors have mentioned 4 areas
                of consideration while creating an application monitoring 
                strategy: Instrumenting applications and infrastructure for 
                data collection, data storage for quick and easy retrieval, 
                aggregation of data to make it suitable for the operations, and

                of database scripting for database initialization and migration
                and integrating those scripts with the continuous delivery 
                process. Then they describe the techniques which can help to 
                roll back databases without losing data and how to release with
                zero-downtime. Next they describe the challenges associated 
                with testing data setup and different approaches that can be 
                used to handle them. Then they discuss the strategies to manage
                data for different stages of automated testing within the 
                deployment pipeline. In the end they provide list of principles
                and practices which can be used to handle the issues with data
                management in automated testing and production environments.

                The authors introduce the chapter with the explanation of
                an important term like componentization and how the 
                abstract use of this term has led to ambiguity around the
                concept. The major advantage of dividing an application 
                into multiple components is that during the integration of
                a major functionality into the system, it reduces the 
                chances of introducing new bugs and even if added to the 
                system, only the particular component has to be mended. 
                The authors claim that for a small project it is understandable
                to have single version control repository, however, a 
                project can expand to a bigger level and that is when need 
                to create discrete component comes in. But, once a project 
                attains a certain threshold it becomes cost inefficient to 
                attempt code componentization. Thumb-rule for a continuous 
                integration process is to keep the application releasable.
                One of the universally accepted solutions to this is 
                'version control', however, it is less-efficient and a better
                approach to obtain a high optimal solution to allow 
                everyone to work on the mainline.

                <p>
                In this chapter, the authors dive into the concept of version
                control mechanism, discussing from the history to the needs 
                which gave birth to version control. The authors then discuss
                the in-depth history of version control systems like CVS, 
                Subversion (SVN), and Commercial Version Control Systems 
                (Perfore, AccuRev, BitKeeper). To explain the components of 
                version control, the authors briefly explain the concept of
                branching and merging. The branching basically facilitates 
                the ability to perform parallel development by different 
                groups or individuals without affecting each other's work. 
                Also, they provide with multiple logical reasons on why 
                different teams may branch the code. Further, they introduce 
                the Distributed Version Control Systems (DVCS), followed by 
                the history and its implementation corporate environment. 
                To clarify DVCS in details, the authors also exemplify 
                the workflow diagram for it. In conclusion, the authors 
                present various options around version control system to 
                ensure an efficient development process, however, an important
                 exercise is to continuously push the developed code bit
                 regularly to the mainline code, minimize the risk.

                    Chapter 15: Managing Continuous Delivery
                </summary>
                <p>
                In the last chapter of the book, the authors primarily focus
                on the management of a development project. They state that an
                effective collaboration depends on the stakeholders or people 
                involved and there willingness to bring changes to the project.
                The authors have presented with four major sections in the
                chapter to assist in the adaptation of continuous delivery 
                within an organization, namely, maturity model, project 
                lifecycle, risk management and common delivery problems. With 
                respect to the maturity model, the authors believe that 
                organizational change is a tough task but can be achieved if
                implemented incrementally and impacts are checked regularly. 
                Also, they have discussed in detail that projects could 
                different in nature, but it is possible to filter the common
                elements from them and generalize a lifecycle for the software
                delivery. The authors have taken a firm stand on the risk 
                management process and have also provided details on how to
                perform a risk-management exercise. In the end, they have 
                mentioned symptoms and causes for few common delivery problems
                like infrequent or buggy deployment, poor application quality,
                poorly managed continuous integration process, and poor 
                configuration management.
