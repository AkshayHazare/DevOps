                    experience helpingdevelopment organizations optimize the entire
                    software value stream. This book uses Toyota and its "make
                    it when need it" idea to illustrate the modern ways of
                    developing softwares.[1]

                  Chapter 1: History
                </summary>
                <p>
                  The book starts with historical stories about Toyota Production
                  System which, according to the designer Taiichi Ohno, was designed
                  to "eliminate waster abosulutely"(page 5). One of the writers was
                   working in a cassette plant when Japanese competitors entered
                   the market with a much lower price. She described her experience
                    about how she adopted the idea as an example of how lean production
                     works before the term was invented.
                  According to the writer, the key to a successful lean production
                  is to put the Just-in-Time flow and stop-the-line together.
                  Just-in-Time means you only produce when you customer makes a
                  request and stop-the-line means you stop producing immediately
                  after you find a problem in your system and start investigating.
                  Next, She talked about lean supply chain, lean product development
                  and finally, lean software development.
                  This chapter gives an insightful view about how the term 'lean'
                  was introduced and how it is gradually accepted into the modern
                  enterprises. There are plenty of stories and facts cited in this
                  chapter. The way the author organizes the contents is brilliant
                  and inspiring.

                  Chapter 2: Principles
                </summary>
                <p>
                  This chapter talks about the senven principles of lean software
                  development. The writers not only give detailed explanation
                  on what the principles mean, they also provide a 'Myth' section
                  after each principle, discussing one common wrong understanding
                  of a certain principle. The book starts by pointing out the most
                  important character of software development - "software changes
                  very often"(page 20). It also claims that it assumes the
                  development process should be empirical - "have a high-level
                  concept in mind and then apply feedback-driven methods to
                  implement the concept"(page 21).

                  The seven principles of lean software development the book states are (page 23-41):
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Eliminate all nonvalue-adding waste: These wastes are
                      generally partially done work, churns and unused feature.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Build Quality In: Fix defects as soon as you find them.
                      Write GOOD code the first time. Test-driven development is recommended.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Create Knowledge: When we are implementing what we have
                      planned to do, we tend to find problems in the original
                      way or discover new, better ways. We should make good use
                      of these knowledge instead of sticking to the plan.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Defer Commitment: Make vital decisions only before it is
                      too late because at that time you have the most information
                      on which to chooose. We can't make our software completely
                      flexible but we should make it changable to some degree so
                      it can be modified at several crucial points. Do NOT go too
                      far with an assumption.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Deliver Fast: Because if you deliver fast, your customers
                      don't have the time to change their requirements. You can
                      also receive more feedback from them and therefore align
                      your product more accurately with their needs, thus reducing
                      the non-value-adding wastes.
                    </li>
                    <li>

                Chapter 3: Value
              </summary>
              <p>
                The chapter starts with how Google creates their lean solution
                to Web search. The writer claims that Google's simple home page
                is a sample of a lean solution where "there is no bunch of ads
                or pop-ups, just a search bar and the buttons the user truly
                needs"(page 44). This is what Google makes their customers happy.
                Google also focuses on customer satisfaction first. They only
                start thinking about how to make money(create value) after user
                happiness is achieved.
                Then, the writer talks about how Google's lean solution moved
                from concept to cash and points out the key factor that leads
                to its success. According to the author (page 44-46), for the
                concept stage, Google gives people with inspiration time and
                effort to pursue it. Therefore, new ideas and improvements are
                always welcome. For the feasibility stage, Google's founders did
                a lot of experiments and created a design that made it easy to
                do system upgrades. The author emphasizes that a good start design
                is crucial so experiments in feasibility stage are crucial as well.
                For the pilot stage, the book says that no start design is perfect
                and improvements should be made after we get feedbacks from our
                users, which is what Google sticks to. Finally, for the cash stage,
                Google also did plenty of tests to make sure their ads are not
                damaging user experience.
                Next, the book moves on to talk about how to make your customers
                happy. A model called "Kano model" is introduced, which shows that
                in order to make your customers as delightful as possible,
                meeting their needs they ask for is not enough - You need to dive
                into their world, find out what they forget to mention but truly
                need and surprise them (page 49-50). To achieve this, you
                need deep customer understanding and to focus on the job -
                on what your customers want to do with your software.
                In this section, the book cites two examples, one from a
                reporter the writer met in an interview and an software engineer
                 worked for P&amp;G.
              </p>
              <p>
                Next, the book talks about how to surprise your customers.
                It emphasizes on good leadership and complete team. The writer
                gives an example about the development of Toyota's Sienna where
                the chief engineer drove the car for thousands of miles on his own
                so he could figure out what the customer wants. He also points out
                several problems in how to create good leadership. First, some
                organizations ask the chief engineer to focus more on risk management
                rather than integrate knowledge. Second, several good chief engineers
                who founded the enterprise fail to train more good chief engineers
                after they turn CEOs (page 54-55).
                Regarding how to build a customer-focused team, the author
                recommends two ways. First, keep leaders from multiple parts of
                the company together to form the team. Second, try to share
                leadership between different parts of the company. Also, you need
                to be sure there is a person who is responsible for the whole
                picture (page 57-58).
              </p>
              <p>
                Finally, the writer introduces two funding models: the project fund model where "everything is funded at the beginning" and the product fund model where "funds are raised gradually" (page 60-61) . The author claims that the first model is generally used in industries and is not suitable for software development. Software development should use the second model instead becaure it fits better for lean.

                Chapter 4: Waste
              </summary>
              <p>
                This chapter talks about where wastes come from and how to avoid them. The author gives explanations togther with vivid examples to illustrate them.
                The topic of the first part is how to write less code. In other words, it discusses complexity in software development. The book starts with an example about a clothe design corporation named Zara. Instead of making a lot of clothes at one time, they make clothes on demand. In this way, the company "pays much less expenses on stock, sales and IT management" (page 68). The writer points out that "complexity grows exponently and will finally dominate the costs" (page 69).
                To handle the problem of complexity, the author gives two suggestions. First, we should limit features and functions. Some development teams put a huge amount of features in their product so some of them may suit the need of the customers. This, of course, adds great complexity to the software making it extremely hard and expensive to maintain. We should "justify for the features" (page 70) we put in our software, "minimize the feature sets" (page 71) so only those needed by our customers are added, and finally, we should "NOT automate complexity" (page 72).
                The second part of the chapter talks about 'the seven wastes' of software development that is derived from Toyota's Seven Waste in auto manufacturing. Here we list the seven wastes and the way the book proposes to handle them (page 74-81).
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Partially Done Work: Divide works into small batches or
                    iterations
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Extra Features: Do not deploy them unless the
                    customers need it
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Relearning: Engage people with knowledge in development
                    process and keep what we have learned (further
                    discussions in Chpater 7)
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Handoffs(give people something without telling them how
                    to use it): More face-to-face communication instead of
                    just handing them stacks of documents; use cross-functional
                    teams so everyone in the team understands what other people
                    are doing
                  </li>
                  <li>
                      Task Switching: Let developer finish what they are
                      doing before making them do something else. Furthermore,
                      do NOT fix this problem by forming a separate maintenance
                      team, which is against agile principles. A team should
                      handle the full cycle of its products.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                      Delays: Create collocated teams; make iterations short;
                      regular feedbacks among team members.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                      Defects: Make defects at a low rate at the beginning
                      of the development. Make sure you test in the customers'
                      environment as well. Also, testing to find errors is a
                      waste while testing to prevent errors is what we truly
                      want.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                At last, the book discusses about value streams, a timeline
                showing "what happens between the moment a customer makes an
                order to the time we deliver the product"(page 83). The author
                claims that "a value stream should always start and end with a
                customer and the aim of our lean approach is to remove all the
                non-value adding procedures in the stream"(page 83). To create a
                value stream, first, we need to decide what to map. Then, we
                should decide when to start and end. Remember to idenitfy an
                owner of value stream and keep it as simple as
                possible(page 84-85).
                Next, the book gives detailed examples of value streams. It
                analyzes what wastes are included in the timeline and explains
                the lean principles using these samples. It points out that to
                diagnose problems in the value stream is to find churns and
                \delays. Finally, if we want to create a future map, make sure
                we only draw the immediate improvements. We should draw a new
                one once these improvements are done(page 92)

                Chapter 5: Speed
              </summary>
              <p>
                This chapter talks about how speed impacts software development
                and how to achieve fast delivery. It starts with a story about
                PatientKeeper, a software company that dominates the market of
                patient information presentation by delivering products and
                features much faster than other competitors. The author explains
                the secrets behind this, which gives the readers an insight into
                 the contents of this chapter. Then, the writer introduces a
                 methodology on how to measure the quality of software development:
                 "to measure the AVERAGE time yoru team spend to deliver a product
                 or release" (page 98-99). The writer explains the word 'AVERAGE'
                 clearly. For products with different sizes, try to establish a
                 regular tiem for your release cycle, for example, two weeks or two
                 months.
                Next, the book gives an equation called Little's Law which says
                that cycle time is calculated by dividing number of things in
                process by the average completion rate (page 100). Therefore, it
                becomes obvious that to speed things up (to reduce cycle time) is
                to increase average completion rate or reduce the number of things
                in process. The book claims that "the former generally requires more
                money while the latter doesn't" (page 101). The book moves on to discuss
                variations and utilization. It gives a real life example where,
                in general, when a server's utilizaton rate goes high, say 80%,
                the server tends to slow down. Therefore, we don't use our servers
                to maximum utilization. However, when managing software engineers,
                we almost always try to use our people to maximum utilization.
                The writer points out the controversy here and claims that we
                shouldn't focus on maximizing utilization but instead, "assign
                work into small batches and keep more attention on making the
                work flow more easily" (page 102).
                On the topic of reducing cycle times, the author gives the six
                different suggestions(page 103). All of them are illustrated by
                real life examples both from industries and software development.
                We see a lot of stories told by one of the author in this part.
                They make the points clearer and more convincing.

              </summary>
              <p>
                This chapter is mainly about how to treat and value poeple's ideas
                in the lean software development. The chapter starts with an
                Interesting example from Boeing 777[2]. The example illustrate
                how Boeing beats other competitors by listening to people and their
                customers. There is one line I find most interesting and insightful
                is that "share early and share often"[3]. Personally, from my
                experience in developing, the customers' opinions are often arrived
                at very late stage of the developemt process, which sometimes results
                in great conflicts at the end. The idea behind this chater is to
                let us know that, we need to keep customers and developers idea
                and their comments in mind at all time.
