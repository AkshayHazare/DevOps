                    Our Security Implementation
                </h1>

                <p>
                    We are responsible for the security of the DevOps Project. 
                    We have used the best security industry practices and 
                    ensure every other team to be in compliance with that.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Initially, We started understanding the system, its 
                    component, and interactions between them. We spent a good 
                    amount of time to holistically analyze the system to find 
                    various threat vectors. Our focus was to build a robust 
                    and secure infrastructure and hence we scope the web 
                    application and Network infrastructure for our security 
                    testing.

                    <h4> Web Application Penetration Testing </h4>
                    <p>
                        We configured ZAP on our local system which is the Web 
                        Application Vulnerability tool and pointed it to the 
                        Django. We ran an attack on the system to find any 
                        vulnerability. This tools produced a bunch of 
                        potential vulnerability which we shared with the 
                        development team along with mitigation technique to 
                        fix this.

                    <h4> Network Penetration Testing </h4>
                    <p>
                        For performing Network based penetration testing we 
                        followed the standard approach which involves mainly 
                        six steps.

                            <li>Reconnaissance</li>
                            <li>Scanning</li>

                            <li>Exploitation</li>
                            <li>Post Exploitation</li>
                            <li>Reporting</li>
                        </ul>  
                    </p>  
                    <br/>

                        <img src="images/dns.png" 
                        style="width:604px;height:442px;">

                    <figure>
                        <img src="images/nmap.png"

                    <br/>
                    <p> 
                        We did not find any vulnerability with the application 
                        server hosting the django website. There were few XSS 
                        low level warnings which were conveyed to developers. 
                        While doing a network based security testing namely a 
                        black box testing of the infrastructure hosting the 
                        server, we found only port open was the port 80 and 
                        rest of the ports were either close and block by 
                        firewall. After analysing the service version, we did 
                        not see any vulnerability associated with it. So, we 
                        conluded the infrastructure was secure based on our 
                        testing artifacts.

                    <h4>Application Source Code Review</h4>

                    <p>
                        Our source code analysis found 8 low severity bugs in 
                        the Django based Quiz system. that were raised as 
                        issues in GitHub. These issues were promptly handled 
                        and appropriate measures were taken. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The following are the bugs that we discovered in the 
                        Quiz system:

                    <h4>Additional Implementation</h4>

                    <p>
                        We also set up the GitHub app to track Issues as they 
                        are added to GitHub to be reported to a specific slack 
                        channel. This slack channel would be monitored by all 
                        teams involved in the development of the Quiz website.
