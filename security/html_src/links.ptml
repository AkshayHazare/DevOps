                        Rugged DevOps is the practice of shifting Security left.
                        Security teams can introduce security much earlier in the
                        development process. This is contrary to the standard
                        approach where security practices of code analysis and
                        vulnerability testing is placed just before the
                        application is deployed into production.

                        Introducing security practices earlier in the software
                        engineering will enable developers to always think of
                        security while developing their application. This will
                        also enable them to come up with creative solutions for
                        enabling security in their applications.

                    <br />
                        DevOps provides a method to have the concept of "Security
                        by Design" integrated into the software engineering
                        lifecycle from the start. It also helps keep security
                        balanced with business objectives.

                        Performing a Automated/Manual penetration testing in SDLC can help to find
                        vulnerability at early stage of development and reduce the threat to the system.
                        Its good to work in tandem with penetration tetsing team to build a robust

                        Performing a Network or Infrastructure based penetration testing helps to identify the weak links
                        inside the network components such as Servers, it also detects presence/absence of firewalls, NIDS/HIDS, vulnerable
                        ports and services running on them. The early detection and mitigation of these vulnerabilities can help an organisation
                        to build a robust and secure infrastructure. NMAP is an important tools to scan ports and find vulnerable services running
                        on a server.

                         Secure coding is the practice of writing programs that are resistant to attack by malicious or mischievous people or programs.
                         Secure coding helps protect a user’s data from theft or corruption. In addition, an insecure program can provide access for an
                         attacker to take control of a server or a user’s computer, resulting in anything from a denial of service to a single user to
                         the compromise of secrets, loss of service, or damage to the systems of thousands of users.

                         Various problems affecting the cloud are insecure interface APIs, shared resources, data breaches, malicious insiders, and misconfiguration issues.
                         The potential attack vectors could be storage enumeration attack, link swap attacks, leaked access tokens, Key management and legal concerns.
                         Deploying mitigation techniques like second factor authentication, encrypted key management, Logging, Audits can help to reduce the risk.
